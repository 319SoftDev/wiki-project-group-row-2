## Cast
The world, alongside the player's thoughts and observations, are recounted by the game's narrator (Amelia Tyler), acting as BG3's dungeon master. While the narrator was originally planned to deliver lines contemptuously, Larian was impressed by Tyler's deadpan delivery. Of the ten companions, six can be chosen as the player character in the character creator. Known as origin characters, they have a pre-set character class, race, and appearance. Although their classes can be changed, origin character personalities and backstories are sometimes related to them.

- Astarion is a hedonistic vampire spawn voiced by Neil Newbon. At the game's start, Astarion has recently escaped his vampire master, Cazador. Newbon's performance was partly inspired by the harlequin figure of commedia dell'arte. Of the origin characters, Astarion was the second most selected protagonist.
- Gale (Tim Downie) is a wizard from the city of Waterdeep, and the most popular choice for origin character playthroughs.
- Shadowheart is a cleric of Shar, the goddess of loss, portrayed by Jennifer English and written by John Corcoran. Originally pitched as a Jason Bourne-style character, she has no memories of her past. She is the most popular romance option for players in the game.
- Lae'zel is a fanatical githyanki with a default base class of fighter. She is quick to anger, disobliging, and the first companion encountered in Baldur's Gate 3. Lae'zel was portrayed by Devora Wilde, with Kevin VanOrd working as her lead writer. Vincke said VanOrd found Lae'zel's "voice" early in development, changing least of the companions during development.
- Wyll is a warlock folk hero. After early access, Wyll's voice actor was changed, with Theo Solomon portraying him in the final release. Wyll's character underwent extensive rewrites following the early access.
- Karlach, a tiefling who is a barbarian by default, was portrayed by Samantha Béart and written by Sarah Baylus. Karlach was heavily iterated across development. According to Béart, she was changed due to similarities to Lae'zel.
- Minthara is an antagonist whose recruitment at launch required an evil playthrough, but Larian made recruiting her easier following release. Written by Sarah Baylus, she was portrayed by Emma Gregory.
- Halsin (Dave Jones) is a wood elf druid and the master of the druids' grove that the player visits during the game's first act. Initially not recruitable during early access, player reception to Halsin was so positive that he was given a companion role.
- Jaheira (Tracy Wiles) is a half-elf druid and leader of the Harpers, an organization dedicated to the preservation of historical lore and knowledge.
-  Minsc (Matthew Mercer) is a human ranger who carries a hamster named Boo with him; Jaheira and Minsc previously appeared in both Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.
