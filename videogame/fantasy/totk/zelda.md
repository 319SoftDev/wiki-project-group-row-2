The legend of zelda is an action-[adventure](../../storygame/story.md) game. Originally released on February 21, 1986 for the Famicom Disk System in Japan and internationally on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. It is the titular launch title of The Legend of Zelda series. The game's plot centers around a young swordsman adventurer in green named Link, to protect the fantasy Kingdom of Hyrule from the evil porcine-like monster Ganon who plans to rule it by force, rescue Princess Zelda, and claim the Triforce to restore peace, which would become the central theme for the currently long-running franchise. Like most other early Zelda games, it has since been re-released multiple times for several platforms, including the Nintendo GameCube, the Game Boy Advance, as well as the Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online. The Japanese version of the game is known as The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda.
