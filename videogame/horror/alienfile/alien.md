## Gameplay
You play as **Amanda Ripley**, daughter of Ellen Ripley, as she explores the Sevastopol space station to uncover the fate of her mother.  

* The main threat is the **Xenomorph**, an intelligent alien that cannot be killed.  
* Players must use stealth: hide in lockers, crouch under tables, and use distractions like noisemakers.  
* Hostile humans and androids ("Working Joes") also patrol the station.  
* Tools include a **motion tracker**, crafting system, and a flamethrower (later in the game) to temporarily repel the alien.  
* The design emphasizes tension, limited resources, and survival rather than combat.\
