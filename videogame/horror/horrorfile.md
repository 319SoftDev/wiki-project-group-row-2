## What is a Horror game?

A horror game is a video game genre centered on horror fiction and typically designed to scare the player. Horror games are nearly always based on narrative or visual presentation, and use a variety of gameplay types


## Sub-genres
### Psychological horror:
Psychological horror games are meant to scare the player through emotional, mental, or psychological states rather than through monsters or other scares. The fear comes from "what is not seen, rather than what is".These games commonly rely on the player-character's unreliable perceptions or questionable sanity in order to develop the story.

### Jump Scare horror: 

Jump scare horror games are designed around moments aimed to immediately surprise or shock the player when they do not expect it, as well as creating a sense of dread while anticipating the next jump scare. 

#### [Outlast](outlast/outlastfile.md)
Outlast is a jump scare game, but it is also more than that; while it utilizes jump scares, the horror experience is built on a foundation of atmosphere, psychological terror, sound design, and a lack of player defense to create intense suspense and fear.\
