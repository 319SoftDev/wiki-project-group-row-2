## What are Video Games?
**Video games** are electronic games that involve interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a screen. Players control characters or elements in a virtual environment using devices like controllers, keyboards, or touchscreens.

Games can range from simple puzzles to complex, story-driven adventures and are available on various platforms like computers, consoles, and smartphones. They can be single-player or multiplayer, and genres include action, strategy, sports, simulation, and more.

Video games are popular for entertainment, but they also have applications in education, training, and therapy.
