### Interactive film Adventure Game:
An interactive film game is a type of video game that gives a cinematic feel and uses player choices to specific narrative. The key components are player agnecy, story focus and minimal gameplay as choices only come so often within the game. [Life Is Strange](strangelife/strangelife.md) is a key example of an interactive film adventure game. Although interactive film has minimal gameplay in Life is Strange this isnt the case as the main character is often in situations where they need to react quick and search in certain locations.
